This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

Okay, starting my own personal journey here.

First I wanted to load the data from Times Series class. 

The following code chunk succeeds in loading the initial data set from a "can view with link" google sheet.

Since at this point I'm not proficient in slicing data, I opted for this solution as a first.

```{r}
library(googlesheets4)
gs4_deauth()
googlesheet <- "1wGjhr4LRb-TBkZbVqkQHv1nO4CLd1M1CtmMuJATIAGQ"
x <- read_sheet(
  googlesheet, 
  range = "Sheet1!C2:F18", 
  col_types = "icid")
```
By trying to learn more about how to use R for time series analysis, which is what I need somewhat soon, I ended up following a youtube from the same channel that our lesson was from (Simplilearn).
They use this dataset for the analysis, so I'm loading that.


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
germ_csv <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenfly/opsd/master/opsd_germany_daily.csv"
y <- read.csv(germ_csv,
              header = TRUE,
              #row.names = "Date"
              )
```
I will postpone researching conflicting package names when loading the tidyverse for now.

Adding the row.names argument remove the name from the view. Interesting...


```{r}
y$Date
```
